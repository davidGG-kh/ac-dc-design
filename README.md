# AC-DC Design

This electronic appendix includes the GAMS source code for the formulation and
NGBD solution algorithm for the mixed AC-DC electricity distribution system
design problem described in the article:

> S. M. Frank and S. Rebennack, "Optimal Design of Mixed AC-DC Distribution
> Systems for Commercial Buildings: A Nonconvex Generalized Benders
> Decomposition Approach," *European Journal of Operational Research*, 2014,
> accepted for publication.

Much of the source code is extended from the following dissertation:
    
> S. M. Frank, "Optimal Design of Mixed AC-DC Distribution Systems for
> Commercial Buildings," Dissertation, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO,
> 2013. Available: http://disexpress.umi.com/dxweb, UMI #3558161.
    
In addition to the descriptions provided in the article and dissertation, the
code in this appendix is self-documented via extensive comments at the head of
and within each file. The `Test`, `Batch`, and `Case_Studies` directories also
include local README files which describe the directory contents and provide
some usage guidance. If you're looking for a place to start, try the README in
the `Test` directory.
